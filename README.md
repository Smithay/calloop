# calloop

Calloop, a Callback-based Event Loop

This crate provides an `EventLoop` type, which is a small abstraction
over epoll or kaqueue for unix systems. The main difference between this crate
and other traditional rust event loops is that it is based on callbacks:
you can register several event sources, each being associated with a callback
closure that will be invoked whenever the associated event source generates
events.

This crate was initially an implementation detail of `wayland-server`, and has been
split-off for reuse. I expect it to be more useful for GUI programs or graphical
servers (like wayland-based apps) than performance critial networking code, which are
more versed towards `tokio` and async-await. It mostly shines in the conception of
modular infrastructures, allowing different modules to use the same event loop without
needing to know about each other.

### How to use it

```rust
extern crate calloop;

use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    // Create the event loop
    let mut event_loop = calloop::EventLoop::try_new().expect("Failed to initialize the event loop!");
    // Retrieve an handle. It is used to insert new sources into the event loop
    // It can be cloned, allowing you to insert sources from within sources
    let handle = event_loop.handle();

    /*
     * Setup your program, inserting event sources in the loop
     */

    // Actual run of your loop
    loop {
        // Dispatch received events to their callbacks, waiting at most 20 ms for
        // new events
        //
        // The `&mut shared_data` is a mutable reference that will be forwarded to all
        // your callbacks, allowing them to easily share some state
        event_loop.dispatch(Some(Duration::from_millis(20)), &mut shared_data);

        /*
         * Insert here the processing you need to do do between each event loop run
         * like your drawing logic if you're doing a GUI app for example.
         */
    }
}
```

### Event source types

This crate provides some adapters for common event sources such as:

- MPSC channels
- Timers
- unix signals

As well as generic handler for monitoring file desriptors.

It is also possible to insert "idle" callbacks. These callbacks represent computations that
need to be done at some point, but are not as urgent as processing the events. These callbacks
are stored and then executed during `EventLoop::dispatch(..)`, once all events from the sources
have been processed.

### Custom event sources

You can create custom event sources that can inserted in the event loop by
implementing the `EventSource` trait.
